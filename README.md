# music_theory_cycles_001
Some work over musical combinatorics

Plans so far:

* Make it to collect all significant information
* Add that data to pSQL database (code will be around)
* Add information like what this all about, and where the music
* Get results of the app and make it listenable with [NFugue](https://github.com/mchudy/NFugue)
* Comment all code out
